// @tactical-graphics/app6d/symbols — the full APP-6D catalog, exported as a

// Nothing here runs as an import side effect. APP6D_CATALOG is a real,
// directly-used export built once at module-evaluation time from plain
// data — which is what makes it safe against bundler tree-shaking and
// chunk-splitting duplication: there's a genuine exported binding for
// every consumer to depend on, not a "run this module for its effects"
// import with nothing to hold onto. If a bundler ends up with more than
// one copy of this module loaded, each copy just builds an identical,
// independent (immutable) catalog — harmless, unlike the old registry
// design where duplication meant writes and reads landed in different
// Maps.
